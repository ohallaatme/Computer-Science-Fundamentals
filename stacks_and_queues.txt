Short Answer

1. 

Q: What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

A: The main difference between a stack and a queue is that a stack handles the last item first (LIFO) whereas a queue handles the first item first (FIFO).

2.

Q: What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

A: Both are lines for tasks to eventually be completed. Both are a way of ordering tasks within code.

3.

Q. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options-which structure would you use for each and why?

A: I would do the following:

UNDO - I would use LIFO - I would want to remove the last thing I did in undo, so last in first out is most appropriate to perform an action on the last item.

REDO - I would use LIFO because if I want to redo something I will start with the most recent item.


Programming Questions

1. 

a. Plan

FUNCTION reverse string (string)
	FOR each character in string
		CALL stack.push WITH character
	END FOR
	WHILE stack not blank
		CALL stack.pop RETURNING character
		APPEND character to reversed
	END WHILE
	RETURN reversed
       END FUNCTION



b. Code

```JavaScript

function reverseString(str) {
    var newString = "";
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i>=0; i--) {
        newString += str[i];
    }
    return newString;
}

```

2.

```JavaScript
 function stack(queue) {
	let first, last;

	for(let i=0; I < queue.length; I++) {

		if(i !== queue.length - 1) {
			first = queue.shift();

			queue.push(first);
			console.log(queue);

		}else {
			last = queue.shift();
			console.log(queue)

		}
	}

	return last;

```JavaScript
class BothQueues {
   constructor(){
     this.elements = []
   }
  

  enqueue(element)
{    
    this.elements.push(element);
}


  dequeue()
{
    if(this.isEmpty())
        return "Empty";
    return this.elements.shift();
}
  
isEmpty()
{
    return this.elements.length ==0;
}

}
